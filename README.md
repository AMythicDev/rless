# rless

A pager in rust, mainly implemented by using [minus](https://github.com/arijit79/minus/commit/f3ab74cf955bca00b1d0b0ed3ade1de0fd4390de).

## Usage

Head on over to the [Releases](https://github.com/Takashiidobe/rless/releases/latest) page and download `rless`. Move it somewhere on your $PATH and you're ready to go!

You can open a file with `rless $FILENAME` just like normal less.
