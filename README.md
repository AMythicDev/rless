# rless

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**:
`rless` was previously under @takashiidobe's ownership but has been since overtaken by @arijit79. With this I hope for
a nice reboot of the project and develop it furthur to turn it into something that can become more widely used rather than being a niche project.

A pager in rust, mainly implemented using [minus](https://github.com/arijit79/minus/commit/f3ab74cf955bca00b1d0b0ed3ade1de0fd4390de).

## Usage

Head on over to the [Releases](https://github.com/Takashiidobe/rless/releases/latest) page and download `rless`. Move it somewhere on your $PATH and you're ready to go!

You can open a file with `rless $FILENAME` just like normal less.
